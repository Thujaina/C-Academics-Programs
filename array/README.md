📌 Program 1: Single-Dimensional Array

✅ Description
This program demonstrates the use of a single-dimensional array in C#. It initializes an array of integers and prints each element along with its index.

🔍 Key Concepts
Array declaration and initialization
Index-based traversal using for loop
Output display with formatted text
🧾 Sample Output
Array Elements:
Element at index 0: 10
Element at index 1: 20
Element at index 2: 30
Element at index 3: 40
Element at index 4: 50
▶️ How to Run
Save the code in a file named SingleDimensionalArray.cs.
Compile using the terminal:
csc SingleDimensionalArray.cs
Run the executable:
SingleDimensionalArray.exe


📌 Program 2: Multi-Dimensional Array (2D) — Student Marks

✅ Description
This program demonstrates the use of a two-dimensional array to store marks of 3 students in 4 subjects. It collects user input for marks, calculates the total for each student, and displays the result.

🔍 Key Concepts
2D array for tabular data
Nested for loops for input and computation
Summation of elements per row (student)
🧾 Sample Output
Enter marks for Student 1:
  Subject 1: 85
  Subject 2: 90
  Subject 3: 78
  Subject 4: 88

Total marks for Student 1: 341
▶️ How to Run
Save the code in a file named StudentMarks2DArray.cs.
Compile using the terminal:
csc StudentMarks2DArray.cs
Run the executable:
StudentMarks2DArray.exe
