# DayOfWeek Enum Example

This simple C# program demonstrates how to use an `enum` for the days of the week.

## How It Works

- The program defines an enum called `DayOfWeek` representing all days from Sunday to Saturday.
- The user is prompted to enter a number between 0 and 6.
- The program then outputs the corresponding day of the week.

## How to Run

1. Compile the program using a C# compiler:
    ```
    csc DayOfWeekExample.cs
    ```
2. Run the executable:
    ```
    DayOfWeekExample.exe
    ```
3. Enter a number between 0 and 6 when prompted.

## Example Output

```
Enter a number (0-6) to get the day of the week:
3
Day 3 is Wednesday
```

## Purpose

- Learn how to use enums in C#.
- Easily map numbers to meaningful names (like days of the week).
